How this Project Works:

Reads Multiple Reports:
The program loads six different Excel reports related to sales, profit & loss, inventory, employee timesheets, customer interactions, and project budgets.

Filters and Analyzes Key Metrics:
It applies specific business rules to each dataset to highlight important insights, such as:

Sales greater than 100 units in the East and South regions.

Profit & Loss data sorted by highest amounts.

Inventory items with stock below reorder levels.

Employees working overtime (more than 40 hours per week).

Customer interactions marked as “Follow up” within the last 30 days.

Projects that have used more than 90% of their allocated budget.

Generates a Single Summary Excel Report:
The filtered and summarized data is compiled into separate sheets within a single Excel file named management_summary_report.xlsx.

Simple User Interface:
A straightforward GUI with a button allows users to generate the report with one click. Success or error messages are displayed via popup windows.
